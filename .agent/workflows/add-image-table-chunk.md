description: Add image/table chunk
---

Add image/table chunk that follows @formatting.md and @content.md rules. Choose whether it's image or table based on the prompt. If an image file is mentioned, pass that file to knitr::include_graphics().

If properties are specified in the prompt, such as image/table name, out.size, or fig.align, follow and apply those properties.
