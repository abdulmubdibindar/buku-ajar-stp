description: Add cross-reference or citation
---

Add a either cross-reference from certain point in the documents or citation, depending on the ID value specified in the prompt.

Identify the ID value first, then match the ID in all label specified either in the chunks, headings, any part of the documents, or @referensi.bib. Then, pass the most matched id to the cross-reference syntax.

If you are confused, ask clarifying question before deciding. Never decide for yourself.
